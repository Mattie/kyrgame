    "FOREST": "...You're in a dark forest.  Tall, ominous pine trees surround you, their\r\nthick, bristly branches hanging down and making it difficult to proceed in\r\nany direction.  Almost all of the sunlight is blocked out by the densely\r\npacked trees, and the few rays which do filter down create dark, menacing\r\nshadows which seem to dance along the leafy forest floor.  As you glance\r\naround, this location appears to be very similar to the rest of the forest,\r\nmaking it confusing to determine your exact location.",
    "DTPASS": "...You're in a dark, twisting cavern.  Everything around you is complete and\r\ntotal darkness, making it impossible to determine any of the features of this\r\ntwisting passageway.  From somewhere above, tiny drops of water fall upon your\r\nhead, and the air is particularly humid.  The ground feels solid underneath\r\nyour feet, although extremely broken and rocky, and due to the solid darkness,\r\nyou cannot see in which directions you can go.",
    "GOLDEN": "...You're in a golden forest.  You are surrounded by tall, shimmering golden\r\nelm trees, their breathtaking golden branches and leaves scintillating in the\r\nsunlight.  Although formed of solid gold, the trees still appear to be living\r\nin full bloom, swaying enchantingly in the gentle breezes of this wonderful\r\nparadise.  A feeling of eternal love swells within your soul, as though this\r\nis the heaven you've always wished to spend your life in forever.  The trees\r\nblocks most of your view with their sparkling beauty, but you can move off in\r\nany direction.",
    "KRD000": "...You're near a mystical willow tree.  Before you rises the mysterious,\r\neerie silhouette of a willow tree, the most strange and fascinating of all\r\nof the natural magic of Kyrandia.  Although willows are normally associated\r\nwith death and sorrow, this particular tree is unusual, as it radiates an\r\nextremely powerful aura of good -- a miracle of the hailed Goddess Tashanna.\r\nA small, dirt path winds off to the north, and dark forest surrounds you in\r\nall other directions.",
    "KRD001": "...You're on a north/south path.  Surrounded by tall, ominous pine trees,\r\nyou're located on a narrow dirt path which twists off to the north and south.\r\nDark forest leads off to the east and west sides of this little road, which\r\nextends beyond your vision into dark undergrowth.  Somewhere nearby you hear\r\nthe chirping of a songbird singing a faintly familiar romantic melody.  The\r\nunmistakable aroma of blooming roses also hangs in the air, although you\r\ncannot see its origin.",
    "KRD002": "...You're at a \"T\" intersection on a path.  In a small clearing of the dark\r\nforest here a narrow north/south path intersects with a smooth road that leads\r\noff to the east.  Although it seems the road may have at one time extended\r\nfurther to the west, it has long since been overgrown by dark forest.  The\r\nsunlight seems particularly bright here, especially in contrast to the dark\r\nforest which surrounds you.  For some unknown reason, as you look around,\r\nmemories run through your mind of long lost love.",
    "KRD003": "...You're on an overgrown path.  Thick, ugly-looking bushes have crowded\r\nover whatever road used to continue from here.  Particularly nasty thorn\r\nbushes and twisting, spiny vines discourage you from digging through this\r\nwild overgrowth.  Several annoying gnats swarm about you as you examine this\r\nchaos of nature, biting painfully at your face and neck.  The heat and\r\nhumidity of this particular location brings a sweat to your forehead, almost\r\nas though magically induced.  An intersection of several paths is just off\r\nto the south, and dark forest surrounds you in all other directions.",
    "KRD004": "...You're on an east/west road.  Cleared through the thick forest, apparently\r\nages ago, this smooth dirt road shows signs of frequent and recent use.  To\r\nthe east, the road leads to a village in the distance, as well as winding off\r\nthrough the dark forest to the west.  Tall, majestic oak trees line the road\r\nto the north and south, guarding the border of the extensive dark forest.  As\r\nyou glance around, you notice the word \"zennyra\" written in the middle of the\r\nroad.",
    "KRD005": "...You're on the outskirts of a village.  Before you lies a high wall of\r\nlarge oak logs, carved to deadly, pointed pinnacles at the top.  A thin\r\ncolumn of smoke rises from beyond the wall, along with the odor of cooking\r\nfood and other strange smells.  This is apparently one of the few dwellings\r\nof human inhabitants within the Great Forest of Kyrandia.  An entrance into\r\nthe villages is to the east, a path winds off to the west, and dark forest\r\nlies in all other directions.",
    "KRD006": "...You're in the village square.  Located directly within the village gates,\r\nthis well-kept plaza has been landscaped with tall, beautiful oak trees, lush,\r\ngreen hedges, and splendid assortments of flowers.  Various paths, all in good\r\ncondition, lead off in all directions.  To the north is a small hut with smoke\r\nrising from it, to the south lies a intriguing, little shop, to the east is\r\nthe village temple, and a path leading out into the forest is to the west.",
    "KRD007": "...You're at the village temple.  Columns constructed from flawless marble\r\nand arranged in a closely-knit, circular pattern establish this place as the\r\ncenter of the village's religious rites.  Several small elm trees border the\r\ncircumference of this temple, and the interior is laden with numerous\r\nlavender roses bushes, in brilliant, full bloom.  In the center of this holy\r\noutdoors dagoba rests a sunken, marble altar.  A small shanty lies to the\r\nsouth and paths lead off to the north and west.",
    "KRD008": "...You're at the gem cutter's hut.  This quaint, little hut has been built\r\nfrom assorted branches of the forest bound together by dried vines, and all\r\ntwisted and weaved together into a miraculously stable bungalow.  A column\r\nof smoke rises smoothly from a miniature chimney, and strange, spicy odors\r\nfloat from within its walls.  Sitting outside, directly in front of you, is\r\na haggard, old man.  A path winding off to the south leads to the village\r\nsquare.",
    "KRD009": "...You're at the spell shop.  Well-built from attractive redwood, truly a\r\nrare wood in these parts, this mystical hutch is labeled by a charming, purple\r\nsign.  Standing before you is a strangely dressed man who smiles and nods at\r\nyou kindly.  A tingle runs down the back of your neck and you suddenly feel\r\nthe urge to spend large amounts of gold.  A small path winds off to the north\r\nto the village square.  Your eyes seem to drift towards the sign.",
    "KRD010": "...You're at the healer's abode.  Covered in a layer of purple mists, this\r\nmarble shrine is the abode of a kind and gentle healer.  Not only amiable,\r\nthe healer who stands before you is also beautiful.  She smiles at you\r\nsympathetically, and mouths the words \"For a donation, I'll gladly tend to\r\nall your needs...\".  Suddenly, you do feel a little feverish and the need\r\nfor some medical attention.  The temple lies to the south.",
    "KRD011": "...You're at the wise man's shanty.  This dirty, run-down, and odorous piece\r\nof shelter is home to a lonely, eccentric miser who happens to be the wisest\r\nwise man in the land, although not the friendliest.  He is standing just a\r\nlittle off to your right with his hand stretched out, perhaps in greetings,\r\nperhaps for gold.  He grins at you impishly and spits a large glob of some\r\ndisgusting substance which you neither recognize nor care to recognize.  The\r\nonly escape seems to be the temple to the north.",
    "KRD012": "...You're at a bubbling brook.  Twisting its way through the terrain of\r\nthe forest, this sparkling stream of fresh water has surfaced from the depths\r\nof the forest undergrowth to the east to flow visibly along a rocky bed for\r\na short distance.  However, it once again winds through the heavy vegetation\r\nto become hidden as it flows off to the west.  From the sunlight which filters\r\nthrough the dense forest around you, you occasionally see brief, golden\r\nglitters within the brook.  Dark forest continues in all directions.",
    "KRD013": "...You're in the Vale of the Butterflies.  Truly a paradise in reality,\r\nthis magnificent natural beauty is a wonder to behold.  Flowers of all\r\nvarieties, colors, and scents bloom majestically, creating a regal hall\r\nof nature.  Yet even more resplendent and marvelous are the hundreds of\r\nthousands of florid and exotic butterflies which sail all around you, carried\r\nby the gentle breezes of the forest.  Dark forest lies in all directions.",
    "KRD014": "...You're in a glade of pines.  Swaying back and forth in the gentle breezes\r\nof the forest, several clumps of pine trees thrive in this darkened glade.\r\nThe ground is littered with millions of fallen pine needles, creating a spongy\r\nbed on the forest floor.  You also notice several pinecones dangling from\r\nthe trees, some within your reach, although the wind keeps the tree branches\r\nin motion.  The eerie whistling of the wind through the boughs above you sends\r\na shiver down your spine.  Dark forest lies in all directions.",
    "KRD015": "...You're in a small, lush valley.  This fertile dish of the forest is a\r\nlittle below sea level, and as a result the air is sultry and the ground is\r\nwet with the remnants of previous rainfalls.  Several tiny, pink flowers have\r\nsprouted amongst the heavy, green undergrowth, adding a touch of color and\r\nlight to this mass of thriving vegetation.  Dark forest continues off in all\r\ndirections, endlessly.",
    "KRD016": "...You're in a dead wooded glade.  Merely a clump of old, leafless, and\r\nrotting fir trees.  Whatever pestilence caused their death, its evil seems\r\nto linger in the air and the ghostly fingers of the barren branches almost\r\nseem to reach out for you, beckoning you to your death.  An icy wind blows\r\nacross your face and whistles harrowingly through the dead limbs.  Something\r\nabout this location fills your soul with fear, and your heart beats faster\r\nas you glance around in terror of this unknown evil.  Dark forest lies off\r\nin all directions.",
    "KRD017": "...You're at an ancient grave.  Eerie white mists float hauntingly around\r\na slab of marble with strange etchings carved into its polished surface.\r\nYou hear the spine-tingling shriek of an owl somewhere high above in the midst\r\nof the dark branches of the surrounding ash trees.  A cold, biting wind nips\r\nat your face and you feel as though someone, or something, is watching your\r\nevery move intensely.  Dark forest lies off in all directions.",
    "KRD018": "...You're near a hollow stump.  Protruding from the dense undergrowth of the\r\nforest, this decrepit and decaying stump has been hollowed out by time and\r\nnature.  Although you cannot see through the darkness of the stump, you can\r\nsmell a putrid odor of unimaginable origin.  You hear the faint rush of\r\nrunning water off to the north and dark forest surrounds you in all\r\ndirections.",
    "KRD019": "...You're at a flaming thicket.  Radiating intense energy, this blazing\r\nnatural inferno glows a deep red as its orange tongues of fire lash out\r\nat you aggressively.  Although you can feel the destructive power of this\r\nconflagration, it doesn't seem to spread beyond the thicket and, even more\r\nsurprisingly, the thicket appears perfectly intact and unharmed.  The sporadic\r\ncrackles of the fire make you jump.  Dark forest lies off in all directions.",
    "KRD020": "...You're at the Tree of Rubies.  This glittering tree of magic is covered\r\nwith big, beautiful, and shining rubies which seem to be begging to be plucked\r\nfrom their branches.  However, you also hear several strange hissing sounds\r\ncoming from within the dark recesses this tree's lush, green leaves.  For some\r\nstrange reason, as you glance around, a vision appears in your mind of a\r\nbeautiful woman who is concealing a dagger for which to slay her lover.  The\r\nvision vanishes as quickly as it had appeared, leaving you wondering about the\r\nduality of the universe for a moment.  Dark forest lies off in all directions.",
    "KRD021": "...You're at the tree of the mockingbird.  This oddly shaped tree has been\r\nnaturally shaped into the likeness of a large bird, wings spread out, mouth\r\nagape in a cry of the wild.  At the very top of the tree you can hear the\r\nflutter of wings, an occasional glimpse of feathers, and the unmistakable\r\ncry of the mockingbird.  The ground is splattered with excess bird remains.\r\nDark forest extends in all directions.",
    "KRD022": "...You're on the banks of a lush lagoon.  To the north a sparkling, deep blue\r\nsea flows out across the horizon.  You're on a beautiful, sandy shore which is\r\nshaded by the boughs of overhanging cypress trees, which extend past the\r\nshoreline and finally touch the water, their leaves floating gently on its\r\nsmooth surface.  As you gaze into the sparkling sea, a beautiful image of the\r\nGoddess Tashanna appears in human form for a fleeting moment and then suddenly\r\ntransforms into a spectacular pegasus and flies away in the chimerical images\r\nof the waves.  Dark forest lies off to the south.",
    "KRD023": "...You're in a natural chapel.  Truly a work of natural magic, this small\r\nspace in the forest has been shaped by the powers of the universe into a\r\nbreathtaking chapel dedicated to the Goddess Tashanna.  The most beautiful\r\nassortment of tall trees, blooming flowers, and luscious bushes you have ever\r\nseen grow in orchestrated harmony in the form of a protected, peaceful, and\r\nenchanting sanction.  To the west, through a natural archway of oaks, lies\r\nan altar, the dark forest extends off in all other directions.",
    "KRD024": "...You're at a silver altar.  Enclosed by large, majestic oak trees, this\r\nsmall alcove is illuminated by a beautiful, shining altar carved from pure\r\nsilver.  It's holy radiance fills your soul with peace and love, leaving you\r\nbreathless with joy.  The altar is surrounded by several lavender rose bushes,\r\ntheir purplish pulchritude complimenting the brilliance of the altar.  The\r\nonly exit is an archway of oaks to the east.",
    "KRD025": "...You're in the Grove of Oaks.  These magnificent and majestic soldiers of\r\nthe forest stand tall and proud, rising above the forest in an aura of sheer\r\npower and wisdom.  Something about their august presence fills your soul with\r\ncourage and determination.  As you glance around, a vision suddenly appears in\r\nyour mind of the Goddess Tashanna, who smiles at you warmly and whispers in\r\nyour ear: \"No matter where you go, I will be with you...\".  The vision then\r\nvanishes as quickly as it had appeared.  Dark forest surrounds you in all\r\ndirections.",
    "KRD026": "...You're in a cluster of ash trees.  Silent and solemn in their pose,\r\nthese ash trees are analogous to coffin bearers in mourning.  You can almost\r\nfeel the sorrow and regret these ancestral guardians of peace, who's realm\r\nhas been disturbed by a spreading pain or evil, which has destroyed the very\r\nroots of their existence.  As you look around, you feel emotion swelling in\r\nyour soul, feeling sorry for the sorrow and pain of the world.  Dark forest\r\nlies in all directions.",
    "KRD027": "...You're near a strange, large rock.  This uniquely shaped boulder dominates\r\nthis small, dark clearing within the surrounding forest.  The ground is rather\r\ndamp and muddy, and the air is rather moist and muggy.  A faint, purplish mist\r\nhovers around the base of the rock, creating an aura of divine mysticism.  The\r\nsunlight which filters down through the surrounding trees creates fantastical\r\nshadows, seeming to dance with their own souls.  Dark forest surrounds you in\r\nall directions.",
    "KRD028": "...You're at an abandoned campsite.  This small clearing has the remains of\r\na campsite littered about its center.  Ashes from a fire, broken branches, and\r\ntrampled undergrowth mark this place as a once well-used base camp.  Written\r\non a nearby tree, apparently carved by a previous camper, is the phrase:\r\n\"Travel fast and travel far...\"; the writing then ends abruptly.  Dark forest\r\nlies off in all directions.",
    "KRD029": "...You're on a plateau.  Rising slightly above the treeline of the forest,\r\nthis leveled peak of rocky grassland gives you an excellent view of the entire\r\nregion extending for miles in all directions.  Off to the northeast you can\r\nsee the sparkle of the sea, to the west a misty mountain range, and off in\r\nall directions deep, dark forest.  The air is crisp and clean, and you feel\r\ngood to be alive.  A wooded hill slopes down to the east.",
    "KRD030": "...You're on a densely wooded hill.  Sloping steeply up to the west, this\r\nhill is covered with tall pine trees and thick undergrowth.  You hear the\r\nhum of bees in somewhere in one of the nearby pines, accompanied by the\r\nrather annoying, although harmonious, chirping of birds.  The air seems to\r\nbecome cleaner up to the west, and the base of this hill lies down to the\r\neast.",
    "KRD031": "...You're at the base of a densely wooded hill.  A pine covered hill rises\r\nup to the west, although densely overgrown.  Overhanging pine branches sweep\r\npast your head in the intermittent gusts of air which blow down from the hill\r\nto the west.  An odor of sweet flowers emanates from somewhere off to the\r\nsouth, and you hear the faint rush of water off to the north.  For a moment,\r\nas you look around, you get a feeling of loneliness.  Except for the rising\r\nhill to the west, dark forest lies in all other directions.",
    "KRD032": "...You're at a bubbling spring of water.  Crystal-clear water spouts from\r\nthe heavy undergrowth from a small, limestone fissure in the ground.  The\r\nunmistakable scent of springwater fills your nostrils and brings a feeling\r\nof freshness to your soul.  Blooming near this sparkling spray of water, a\r\nbeautiful, lavender rose bush flourishes colorfully.  Dark forest stretches\r\noff in all directions.",
    "KRD033": "...You're in a shady, natural shelter.  The boughs of the surrounding elm\r\ntrees have grown together, enclosing this small area into a protected, natural\r\nshelter.  The dirt floor is covered with a layer of dry, fallen leaves.  No\r\nsunlight is able to penetrate through the natural roof of this shelter, and\r\nit is illuminated only by the reflections of the forest around it.  The air is\r\nslightly humid and has an odor of decaying vegetation.  Dark forest continues\r\noff in all directions.",
    "KRD034": "...You're in the Druid's Circle.  This unparalleled spectacle of enchantment\r\nis totally awe-inspiring, and your soul is filled with wonder.  Three silver\r\nrings, encompassing the entire area, magically float in the air, stacked upon\r\neach other.  They are surrounded by a wide circle of the largest and most\r\nmajestic oak trees you have ever laid eyes upon.  In the center of this\r\ndazzling vortex is a brightly glowing orb of pure light, whose brilliance is\r\nalmost blinding.  You can feel the powerful presence of the goddess Tashanna\r\nradiating throughout all of this mystical and holy sphere.  Dark forest lies\r\nin all directions.",
    "KRD035": "...You're at a terraced waterfall.  Gently flowing water tinkling down\r\nlayers of polished, purplish stone paint a majestic landscape before your\r\neyes.  A few rays of sunlight filter through the nearby forest growth to\r\nglitter off the shallow, rushing water, sparkling with a holy radiance.  As\r\nyou behold this natural fascination, a surge of overwhelming emotions fills\r\nyour soul with a love beyond anything describable.  You notice an entrance\r\nto a cave to the north and dark forest lies in all other directions.",
    "KRD036": "...You're at a large, sparkling waterfall.  Rushing white water plunges down\r\nthis great cataract, sending sprays of cold spring water in all directions.\r\nPerhaps the most august, magnificent, and inspiring scene of nature you have\r\never witnessed, this majestic, sparkling cascade takes your breath away with\r\nits sheer natural beauty.  This graceful torrent rushes down into a clear,\r\ndeep pool which flows into a surging stream that vanishes into the undergrowth\r\nto the east.  Several assorted green plants have flourished in the rich soil\r\nnearby, complemented by a few, blooming lavender rose bushes, all adding the\r\nfinal touch of perfection to this heaven on earth.  You see a cavern behind\r\nthe falls to the north, an entrance to a cave to the west, and dark forest\r\nto the south and east.",
    "KRD037": "...You're in a small clearing in a forest.  The sweet smell of springtime\r\ndrifts through the gentle breeze in this small, grassy clearing.  Dew drips\r\nfrom the petals of the assorted flowers which are blooming freely here, and\r\nthe ground is soft and damp.  Above you, the sky is a beautiful, bright shade\r\nof blue with fluffy, white clouds sailing smoothly across the horizon.  Your\r\nsoul feels at peace in this natural sanction.  Surrounding you in all\r\ndirections is a deep, green forest.",
    "KRD038": "...You're near the Fountain of Eternal Magic.  Concealed for eons within\r\nthe depths of the surrounding dark forest, this enchanting and mystical jet\r\nof shimmering, iridescent water rises grandly before you.  Rising from a\r\nbeautiful well, carved from the purest white marble, this resplendent wonder\r\nradiates an aura of powerful sorcery, its glittering water inviting you to\r\ndrink its enticing ambrosia.  A splendid portrait of the Goddess Tashanna\r\nhas been inscribed in the base of this fountain along with an engraving\r\nwhich reads \"aeid treven alliw suoy irof levol yym ftub ayb tseog aemit\r\nsdna issap lsdnegel y f\".  Dark forest lies in all directions.",
    "KRD039": "...You're near a platinum tree.  Yet another wonder of the world of the\r\nGoddess Tashanna, before you rises a magnificent oak tree magically turned to\r\nsolid platinum, sparkling in the sunlight.  Even more awe-inspiring, however,\r\nare the branches of this platinum beauty which have grown together in the\r\nshape of a large heart, emanating an aura of powerful magic and love.  In\r\nthe mystical zephyrs which waft around this tree, you hear whispers of words\r\nthat you cannot clearly hear, but which bring peace to your soul.  Dark\r\nforest surrounds you in all directions.",
    "KRD040": "...You're in a small field of lilacs.  A breezy, sunlit opening within the\r\nvast forest, this small field is alive with the grass and lilacs waving in\r\nthe gentle wind.  Without the tall trees of the forest obstructing too much\r\nof your view, you can now discern large mountains, shrouded in purplish mists,\r\nfar off in the west.  You are also quite aware of the continuous buzzing of\r\nassorted insects which swarm around you in this grassy clearing.  Dark forest\r\nawaits you in all directions.",
    "KRD041": "...You're at the Secret Shrine of Tashanna.  Hidden behind the plunging\r\ncascade of water and covered in purplish mists, this sacred spot radiates an\r\naura of unmatched \"good\".  The shrine itself is in the shape of a unicorn,\r\ncarved from pure silver, which glitters in the spray of the waterfall,\r\nshining in a holy brilliance that fills your soul with awe.  The rest of this\r\nwizened cavern appears to have been carved from solid, unflawed amethyst,\r\nwhich sparkles incandescently, dazzling you with its iridescence.  The only\r\nexit is through the waterfall to the south.",
    "KRD042": "...You're near a large statue.  Located in the middle of dark forest, this\r\nincredible work of art would be amazing if discovered within the finest art\r\ngallery of Kyrandia, and far so lost deep in the center of a dark forest.\r\nYou feel a powerful urge to examine the statue more closely, and in your mind\r\nyou cannot help but to wonder about the nature of the artist who created this,\r\nhis inspiration and dedication.  Dark forest lies in all directions.",
    "KRD043": "...You're at the entrance to a dark cave.  Before you rises a colossal\r\nmountain cliff of solid granite with a small, dark hole at the base, leading\r\ninto a dark cave.  The ground is rather rocky, with assorted patches of grass\r\nsprouting like oases in a desert of gray granite.  To the east, a large\r\nwaterfall thunders loudly, as a smaller, terraced waterfall flows off to the\r\nsouth.  The cave entrance is to the north.",
    "KRD101": "...You're in a dark forest.  Tall, ominous pine trees surround you, their\r\nthick, bristly branches hanging down and making it difficult to proceed in\r\nany direction.  Almost all of the sunlight is blocked out by the densely\r\npacked trees, and the few rays which do filter down create dark, menacing\r\nshadows which seem to dance along the leafy forest floor.  As you glance\r\naround, you happen to notice a small shrine, almost completely hidden in\r\nthe underbrush.  You feel a tingle of excitement in your very heart and\r\nsoul.  It is very confusing to determine your exact location.",
    "KRD170": "...You're in a dark cave.  This natural excavation in the granite of the\r\nmountain is not very large.  The walls, floor, and ceiling of this dark hole\r\nare jagged and uneven making it difficult to keep your balance.  The air is\r\nextremely humid and water drips from the ceiling high above, creating an eerie\r\natmosphere to the entire place.  Sunlight finds its way in from the opening\r\nto the south, and dark, twisting caverns wind off in all other directions.",
    "KRD178": "...You're in a natural hall.  This long passageway has been smoothly carved\r\nfrom the solid granite of this mountain, in contrast to the jagged caverns\r\nto the south.  Oddly enough, there is a strong smell of sulfur in the air,\r\nalmost choking you with its strength.  This strange hall continues off into\r\nthe darkness to the north, from which a cold, eerie wind gently blows.  The\r\ncaverns twist off to the south.",
    "KRD179": "...You're at a bottomless chasm.  At the northern end of a great natural hall,\r\nthis wide, dark pit lies ominously before you, as though taunting you with its\r\nimpassibility.  There appears to be no way around this blockade; the ceiling\r\nof this cavern is very high, the walks are smooth and slippery, and the\r\nchasm expands from wall to wall and is at least twenty feet across.  Far on\r\nthe other side, you see a sparkling jade cavern, its beauty tempting you\r\nalmost mockingly.  There is a natural hall which continues off to the south.",
    "KRD180": "...You're in a jade cavern.  Multiple hues of beautiful jade sparkle around\r\nyou in this cavern of precious gems.  All the walls, floor, and ceiling of\r\nthis incredible natural chamber shine with their own incandescent light, their\r\ncombined brilliance lighting the surroundings in a holy, green aura.  A huge,\r\nbottomless chasm blocks the way to the south, while a dark passage in the far\r\nside of this lovely cavern leads off to the north.",
    "KRD181": "...You're at a statue of Tashanna.  Before you rises a lovely sculptured\r\nstatue of the Goddess Tashanna, Lady of Legends.  It rises from an iron base\r\nand extends up about eight feet to the ceiling of this smooth cavern.  A\r\nbeautifully carved marble path leads off to a large structure to the east.\r\nYou hear a distant thunder of rushing water off to the north, and from a dark\r\npassageway to the south you see a faint glimmer of green light.",
    "KRD182": "...You're near a reflecting pool.  This peaceful and delightful pool has been\r\nornately hand-carved from the purest marble.  The water of the pool is crystal\r\nclear, and it sparkles in the light of this large cavern, reflecting a faint\r\nimage of you as you peer into it.  You also notice many intricate symbols at\r\nthe bottom of the pool, traced by pure gold, although you can identify none of\r\nthem.  A large, marble structure rises off to the east, while a marble path\r\nleads to the west.",
    "KRD183": "...You're at the forgotten Pantheon of Tashanna.  Long lost within the depths\r\nof this hidden underground city, this ancient temple of the Lady of Legends,\r\nTashanna, is perhaps the greatest legend of all Kyrandia.  Folklore of ages\r\npast claim this spot to be the greatest pinnacle of the power of Tashanna.\r\nConstructed from pure marble pillars embedded with mystical symbols of silver\r\nand gold, and covered in purplish mists, this holy sanction radiates an aura\r\nof eternal peace and love.

You can speak with other players using action\r\nverbs.  For example, if you were to type \"say hello there\", other players at\r\nthe same location would see \"hello there.\"  You may pick up objects and do\r\nthings with them.  You can look at your current surroundings or other players.\r\nAlmost any mundane action you can think of can be performed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the world of Kyrandia is much, much more.

Also, some spells require the player to have certain components\r\n(objects) to cast them.  To actually cast the spell, a player must type\r\n\"cast\" and then the secret incantation of the spell to be cast; sometimes,\r\na direct object must be included as well, such as \"at the elf\".\r\n\r\nThe physical strength and endurance of a player is determined by his \"hit\r\npoints.\"  A player's hit points increase as he gains levels or by magical\r\nmeans.  It is through hit points that most players battle each other; when a\r\nplayer's hit points reach 0, he is killed, and must start from scratch at the\r\nbeginning again.\r\n\r\nTo see what spells you have memorized and how many spell points you have,\r\ntype \"spells\".

You gain 2 spell points per level, and you gain\r\n 4 hit points per level.  (see \"help spells\" and \"help hits\").  Each level\r\n also has a \"title\", or name, associated with it.  For example, when you\r\n start at level 1, you are titled \"Apprentice\"; to win the game, you must\r\n become an \"Arch-Mage of Legends\".  (see \"help winning\").\r\n\r\n It is up to you to discover exactly how many levels there are, and their\r\n respective titles.  However, everyone wears a \"Patch of Sorcery\" which\r\n declares their title (type \"look <so-and-so>\").

To become powerful in Kyrandia, you therefore\r\n must master the art of spellweaving.\r\n\r\n The spell system of Kyrandia works like this: every player has a \"spellbook\"\r\n in which he keeps the spells he can memorize; no one can steal this\r\n book, and the player cannot lose it.  Once a spell is in the spellbook, a\r\n player may memorize that spell (type: memorize <spell name>).  You can have\r\n up to ten spells \"memorized\" at the same time.  A player then may cast any\r\n spell he has memorized (type: cast <spell name>).  Some spells also\r\n require a direct object (a target), such as a person, place, or thing; the\r\n direct object should be placed right after the spell name when being cast.\r\n Also note that some spells require certain components (objects) or other\r\n special circumstances to be successfully cast.\r\n\r\n You must also be of a certain level to cast different spells; the most\r\n powerful spells can only be cast by those of high enough level.\r\n\r\n***\r\nThe wizard then bows and vanishes into thin air!",

Upon reaching this high level, you are eligible\r\n to collect any prize the System Operator of this realm may be offering.  The\r\n game will notify you of how to collect your prize and glory.  Let it be\r\n known that only the FIRST player to solve Kyrandia (on this system) may be\r\n the one to receive the prize.\r\n\r\n However, everyone who takes part in the experience of Kyrandia can win; if\r\n not a materialistic award of credits, then many hours of enjoyable gaming,\r\n the thrill of magical Dungeons & Dragons combat, and special insight into a\r\n dreamworld created from true love -- an enchanting, parallel fantasy of the\r\n world of reality in which we all live.\r\n\r\n I'm sorry, but I can't give you any \"hints\" or \"solutions\", because after\r\n all, that would take away all the excitement and adventure I've created for\r\n you!
