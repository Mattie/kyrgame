# Room summary: Dead wooded glade shadowed by fear until a secret phrase banishes it.
# Mechanics: saying the EGLADE phrase triggers a level gate to exactly level 5, leveling the player if matched, otherwise refusing for too high/low levels.
# Tone: dramatic courage test rewarded by the Goddess with wisdom and power when fear is cast aside.
# Legacy: legacy/KYRROUS.C lines 660-676
