# Room summary: Misty healer's abode where a serene healer rewards floral offerings.
# Mechanics: offering a rose removes it, heals 10 HP up to 4× level cap, while other offers are rejected and missing roses get gentle refusals.
# Tone: peaceful gratitude and gentle admonishment toward materialism when the offer is wrong.
# Legacy: legacy/KYRROUS.C lines 410-436
