# Room summary: Cluster of ash trees where tears coax a crystal shard from the ashes.
# Mechanics: cry/weep at the ashes/trees shows shard appearance messages and, if the room
# has space, spawns a shard object on the ground; otherwise warns that the shard vanishes.
# Legacy: legacy/KYRROUS.C lines 677-696
