  LEVEL6: 'Elwynor Technologies: Kyrandia Player Editor'
  FOREST: '...You''re in a dark forest. Tall, ominous pine trees surround you, their
    thick, bristly branches hanging down and making it difficult to proceed in any
    direction. Almost all of the sunlight is blocked out by the densely packed trees,
    and the few rays which do filter down create dark, menacing shadows which seem
    to dance along the leafy forest floor. As you glance around, this location appears
    to be very similar to the rest of the forest, making it confusing to determine
    your exact location.'
  DTPASS: '...You''re in a dark, twisting cavern. Everything around you is complete
    and total darkness, making it impossible to determine any of the features of this
    twisting passageway. From somewhere above, tiny drops of water fall upon your
    head, and the air is particularly humid. The ground feels solid underneath your
    feet, although extremely broken and rocky, and due to the solid darkness, you
    cannot see in which directions you can go.'
  GOLDEN: '...You''re in a golden forest. You are surrounded by tall, shimmering golden
    elm trees, their breathtaking golden branches and leaves scintillating in the
    sunlight. Although formed of solid gold, the trees still appear to be living in
    full bloom, swaying enchantingly in the gentle breezes of this wonderful paradise.
    A feeling of eternal love swells within your soul, as though this is the heaven
    you''ve always wished to spend your life in forever. The trees blocks most of
    your view with their sparkling beauty, but you can move off in any direction.'
  KRD000: '...You''re near a mystical willow tree. Before you rises the mysterious,
    eerie silhouette of a willow tree, the most strange and fascinating of all of
    the natural magic of Kyrandia. Although willows are normally associated with death
    and sorrow, this particular tree is unusual, as it radiates an extremely powerful
    aura of good -- a miracle of the hailed Goddess Tashanna. A small, dirt path winds
    off to the north, and dark forest surrounds you in all other directions.'
  KRD001: '...You''re on a north/south path. Surrounded by tall, ominous pine trees,
    you''re located on a narrow dirt path which twists off to the north and south.
    Dark forest leads off to the east and west sides of this little road, which extends
    beyond your vision into dark undergrowth. Somewhere nearby you hear the chirping
    of a songbird singing a faintly familiar romantic melody. The unmistakable aroma
    of blooming roses also hangs in the air, although you cannot see its origin.'
  KRD002: '...You''re at a "T" intersection on a path. In a small clearing of the
    dark forest here a narrow north/south path intersects with a smooth road that
    leads off to the east. Although it seems the road may have at one time extended
    further to the west, it has long since been overgrown by dark forest. The sunlight
    seems particularly bright here, especially in contrast to the dark forest which
    surrounds you. For some unknown reason, as you look around, memories run through
    your mind of long lost love.'
  KRD003: '...You''re on an overgrown path. Thick, ugly-looking bushes have crowded
    over whatever road used to continue from here. Particularly nasty thorn bushes
    and twisting, spiny vines discourage you from digging through this wild overgrowth.
    Several annoying gnats swarm about you as you examine this chaos of nature, biting
    painfully at your face and neck. The heat and humidity of this particular location
    brings a sweat to your forehead, almost as though magically induced. An intersection
    of several paths is just off to the south, and dark forest surrounds you in all
    other directions.'
  KRD004: '...You''re on an east/west road. Cleared through the thick forest, apparently
    ages ago, this smooth dirt road shows signs of frequent and recent use. To the
    east, the road leads to a village in the distance, as well as winding off through
    the dark forest to the west. Tall, majestic oak trees line the road to the north
    and south, guarding the border of the extensive dark forest. As you glance around,
    you notice the word "zennyra" written in the middle of the road.'
  KRD005: '...You''re on the outskirts of a village. Before you lies a high wall of
    large oak logs, carved to deadly, pointed pinnacles at the top. A thin column
    of smoke rises from beyond the wall, along with the odor of cooking food and other
    strange smells. This is apparently one of the few dwellings of human inhabitants
    within the Great Forest of Kyrandia. An entrance into the villages is to the east,
    a path winds off to the west, and dark forest lies in all other directions.'
  KRD006: '...You''re in the village square. Located directly within the village gates,
    this well-kept plaza has been landscaped with tall, beautiful oak trees, lush,
    green hedges, and splendid assortments of flowers. Various paths, all in good
    condition, lead off in all directions. To the north is a small hut with smoke
    rising from it, to the south lies a intriguing, little shop, to the east is the
    village temple, and a path leading out into the forest is to the west.'
  KRD007: '...You''re at the village temple. Columns constructed from flawless marble
    and arranged in a closely-knit, circular pattern establish this place as the center
    of the village''s religious rites. Several small elm trees border the circumference
    of this temple, and the interior is laden with numerous lavender roses bushes,
    in brilliant, full bloom. In the center of this holy outdoors dagoba rests a sunken,
    marble altar. A small shanty lies to the south and paths lead off to the north
    and west.'
  KRD008: '...You''re at the gem cutter''s hut. This quaint, little hut has been built
    from assorted branches of the forest bound together by dried vines, and all twisted
    and weaved together into a miraculously stable bungalow. A column of smoke rises
    smoothly from a miniature chimney, and strange, spicy odors float from within
    its walls. Sitting outside, directly in front of you, is a haggard, old man. A
    path winding off to the south leads to the village square.'
  KRD009: '...You''re at the spell shop. Well-built from attractive redwood, truly
    a rare wood in these parts, this mystical hutch is labeled by a charming, purple
    sign. Standing before you is a strangely dressed man who smiles and nods at you
    kindly. A tingle runs down the back of your neck and you suddenly feel the urge
    to spend large amounts of gold. A small path winds off to the north to the village
    square. Your eyes seem to drift towards the sign.'
  KRD010: '...You''re at the healer''s abode. Covered in a layer of purple mists,
    this marble shrine is the abode of a kind and gentle healer. Not only amiable,
    the healer who stands before you is also beautiful. She smiles at you sympathetically,
    and mouths the words "For a donation, I''ll gladly tend to all your needs...".
    Suddenly, you do feel a little feverish and the need for some medical attention.
    The temple lies to the south.'
  KRD011: '...You''re at the wise man''s shanty. This dirty, run-down, and odorous
    piece of shelter is home to a lonely, eccentric miser who happens to be the wisest
    wise man in the land, although not the friendliest. He is standing just a little
    off to your right with his hand stretched out, perhaps in greetings, perhaps for
    gold. He grins at you impishly and spits a large glob of some disgusting substance
    which you neither recognize nor care to recognize. The only escape seems to be
    the temple to the north.'
  KRD012: '...You''re at a bubbling brook. Twisting its way through the terrain of
    the forest, this sparkling stream of fresh water has surfaced from the depths
    of the forest undergrowth to the east to flow visibly along a rocky bed for a
    short distance. However, it once again winds through the heavy vegetation to become
    hidden as it flows off to the west. From the sunlight which filters through the
    dense forest around you, you occasionally see brief, golden glitters within the
    brook. Dark forest continues in all directions.'
  KRD013: '...You''re in the Vale of the Butterflies. Truly a paradise in reality,
    this magnificent natural beauty is a wonder to behold. Flowers of all varieties,
    colors, and scents bloom majestically, creating a regal hall of nature. Yet even
    more resplendent and marvelous are the hundreds of thousands of florid and exotic
    butterflies which sail all around you, carried by the gentle breezes of the forest.
    Dark forest lies in all directions.'
  KRD014: '...You''re in a glade of pines. Swaying back and forth in the gentle breezes
    of the forest, several clumps of pine trees thrive in this darkened glade. The
    ground is littered with millions of fallen pine needles, creating a spongy bed
    on the forest floor. You also notice several pinecones dangling from the trees,
    some within your reach, although the wind keeps the tree branches in motion. The
    eerie whistling of the wind through the boughs above you sends a shiver down your
    spine. Dark forest lies in all directions.'
  KRD015: '...You''re in a small, lush valley. This fertile dish of the forest is
    a little below sea level, and as a result the air is sultry and the ground is
    wet with the remnants of previous rainfalls. Several tiny, pink flowers have sprouted
    amongst the heavy, green undergrowth, adding a touch of color and light to this
    mass of thriving vegetation. Dark forest continues off in all directions, endlessly.'
  KRD016: '...You''re in a dead wooded glade. Merely a clump of old, leafless, and
    rotting fir trees. Whatever pestilence caused their death, its evil seems to linger
    in the air and the ghostly fingers of the barren branches almost seem to reach
    out for you, beckoning you to your death. An icy wind blows across your face and
    whistles harrowingly through the dead limbs. Something about this location fills
    your soul with fear, and your heart beats faster as you glance around in terror
    of this unknown evil. Dark forest lies off in all directions.'
  KRD017: '...You''re at an ancient grave. Eerie white mists float hauntingly around
    a slab of marble with strange etchings carved into its polished surface. You hear
    the spine-tingling shriek of an owl somewhere high above in the midst of the dark
    branches of the surrounding ash trees. A cold, biting wind nips at your face and
    you feel as though someone, or something, is watching your every move intensely.
    Dark forest lies off in all directions.'
  KRD018: '...You''re near a hollow stump. Protruding from the dense undergrowth of
    the forest, this decrepit and decaying stump has been hollowed out by time and
    nature. Although you cannot see through the darkness of the stump, you can smell
    a putrid odor of unimaginable origin. You hear the faint rush of running water
    off to the north and dark forest surrounds you in all directions.'
  KRD019: '...You''re at a flaming thicket. Radiating intense energy, this blazing
    natural inferno glows a deep red as its orange tongues of fire lash out at you
    aggressively. Although you can feel the destructive power of this conflagration,
    it doesn''t seem to spread beyond the thicket and, even more surprisingly, the
    thicket appears perfectly intact and unharmed. The sporadic crackles of the fire
    make you jump. Dark forest lies off in all directions.'
  KRD020: '...You''re at the Tree of Rubies. This glittering tree of magic is covered
    with big, beautiful, and shining rubies which seem to be begging to be plucked
    from their branches. However, you also hear several strange hissing sounds coming
    from within the dark recesses this tree''s lush, green leaves. For some strange
    reason, as you glance around, a vision appears in your mind of a beautiful woman
    who is concealing a dagger for which to slay her lover. The vision vanishes as
    quickly as it had appeared, leaving you wondering about the duality of the universe
    for a moment. Dark forest lies off in all directions.'
  KRD021: '...You''re at the tree of the mockingbird. This oddly shaped tree has been
    naturally shaped into the likeness of a large bird, wings spread out, mouth agape
    in a cry of the wild. At the very top of the tree you can hear the flutter of
    wings, an occasional glimpse of feathers, and the unmistakable cry of the mockingbird.
    The ground is splattered with excess bird remains. Dark forest extends in all
    directions.'
  KRD022: '...You''re on the banks of a lush lagoon. To the north a sparkling, deep
    blue sea flows out across the horizon. You''re on a beautiful, sandy shore which
    is shaded by the boughs of overhanging cypress trees, which extend past the shoreline
    and finally touch the water, their leaves floating gently on its smooth surface.
    As you gaze into the sparkling sea, a beautiful image of the Goddess Tashanna
    appears in human form for a fleeting moment and then suddenly transforms into
    a spectacular pegasus and flies away in the chimerical images of the waves. Dark
    forest lies off to the south.'
  KRD023: '...You''re in a natural chapel. Truly a work of natural magic, this small
    space in the forest has been shaped by the powers of the universe into a breathtaking
    chapel dedicated to the Goddess Tashanna. The most beautiful assortment of tall
    trees, blooming flowers, and luscious bushes you have ever seen grow in orchestrated
    harmony in the form of a protected, peaceful, and enchanting sanction. To the
    west, through a natural archway of oaks, lies an altar, the dark forest extends
    off in all other directions.'
  KRD024: '...You''re at a silver altar. Enclosed by large, majestic oak trees, this
    small alcove is illuminated by a beautiful, shining altar carved from pure silver.
    It''s holy radiance fills your soul with peace and love, leaving you breathless
    with joy. The altar is surrounded by several lavender rose bushes, their purplish
    pulchritude complimenting the brilliance of the altar. The only exit is an archway
    of oaks to the east.'
  KRD025: '...You''re in the Grove of Oaks. These magnificent and majestic soldiers
    of the forest stand tall and proud, rising above the forest in an aura of sheer
    power and wisdom. Something about their august presence fills your soul with courage
    and determination. As you glance around, a vision suddenly appears in your mind
    of the Goddess Tashanna, who smiles at you warmly and whispers in your ear: "No
    matter where you go, I will be with you...". The vision then vanishes as quickly
    as it had appeared. Dark forest surrounds you in all directions.'
  KRD026: '...You''re in a cluster of ash trees. Silent and solemn in their pose,
    these ash trees are analogous to coffin bearers in mourning. You can almost feel
    the sorrow and regret these ancestral guardians of peace, who''s realm has been
    disturbed by a spreading pain or evil, which has destroyed the very roots of their
    existence. As you look around, you feel emotion swelling in your soul, feeling
    sorry for the sorrow and pain of the world. Dark forest lies in all directions.'
  KRD027: '...You''re near a strange, large rock. This uniquely shaped boulder dominates
    this small, dark clearing within the surrounding forest. The ground is rather
    damp and muddy, and the air is rather moist and muggy. A faint, purplish mist
    hovers around the base of the rock, creating an aura of divine mysticism. The
    sunlight which filters down through the surrounding trees creates fantastical
    shadows, seeming to dance with their own souls. Dark forest surrounds you in all
    directions.'
  KRD028: '...You''re at an abandoned campsite. This small clearing has the remains
    of a campsite littered about its center. Ashes from a fire, broken branches, and
    trampled undergrowth mark this place as a once well-used base camp. Written on
    a nearby tree, apparently carved by a previous camper, is the phrase: "Travel
    fast and travel far..."; the writing then ends abruptly. Dark forest lies off
    in all directions.'
  KRD029: '...You''re on a plateau. Rising slightly above the treeline of the forest,
    this leveled peak of rocky grassland gives you an excellent view of the entire
    region extending for miles in all directions. Off to the northeast you can see
    the sparkle of the sea, to the west a misty mountain range, and off in all directions
    deep, dark forest. The air is crisp and clean, and you feel good to be alive.
    A wooded hill slopes down to the east.'
  KRD030: '...You''re on a densely wooded hill. Sloping steeply up to the west, this
    hill is covered with tall pine trees and thick undergrowth. You hear the hum of
    bees in somewhere in one of the nearby pines, accompanied by the rather annoying,
    although harmonious, chirping of birds. The air seems to become cleaner up to
    the west, and the base of this hill lies down to the east.'
  KRD031: '...You''re at the base of a densely wooded hill. A pine covered hill rises
    up to the west, although densely overgrown. Overhanging pine branches sweep past
    your head in the intermittent gusts of air which blow down from the hill to the
    west. An odor of sweet flowers emanates from somewhere off to the south, and you
    hear the faint rush of water off to the north. For a moment, as you look around,
    you get a feeling of loneliness. Except for the rising hill to the west, dark
    forest lies in all other directions.'
  KRD032: '...You''re at a bubbling spring of water. Crystal-clear water spouts from
    the heavy undergrowth from a small, limestone fissure in the ground. The unmistakable
    scent of springwater fills your nostrils and brings a feeling of freshness to
    your soul. Blooming near this sparkling spray of water, a beautiful, lavender
    rose bush flourishes colorfully. Dark forest stretches off in all directions.'
  KRD033: '...You''re in a shady, natural shelter. The boughs of the surrounding elm
    trees have grown together, enclosing this small area into a protected, natural
    shelter. The dirt floor is covered with a layer of dry, fallen leaves. No sunlight
    is able to penetrate through the natural roof of this shelter, and it is illuminated
    only by the reflections of the forest around it. The air is slightly humid and
    has an odor of decaying vegetation. Dark forest continues off in all directions.'
  KRD034: '...You''re in the Druid''s Circle. This unparalleled spectacle of enchantment
    is totally awe-inspiring, and your soul is filled with wonder. Three silver rings,
    encompassing the entire area, magically float in the air, stacked upon each other.
    They are surrounded by a wide circle of the largest and most majestic oak trees
    you have ever laid eyes upon. In the center of this dazzling vortex is a brightly
    glowing orb of pure light, whose brilliance is almost blinding. You can feel the
    powerful presence of the goddess Tashanna radiating throughout all of this mystical
    and holy sphere. Dark forest lies in all directions.'
  KRD035: '...You''re at a terraced waterfall. Gently flowing water tinkling down
    layers of polished, purplish stone paint a majestic landscape before your eyes.
    A few rays of sunlight filter through the nearby forest growth to glitter off
    the shallow, rushing water, sparkling with a holy radiance. As you behold this
    natural fascination, a surge of overwhelming emotions fills your soul with a love
    beyond anything describable. You notice an entrance to a cave to the north and
    dark forest lies in all other directions.'
  KRD036: '...You''re at a large, sparkling waterfall. Rushing white water plunges
    down this great cataract, sending sprays of cold spring water in all directions.
    Perhaps the most august, magnificent, and inspiring scene of nature you have ever
    witnessed, this majestic, sparkling cascade takes your breath away with its sheer
    natural beauty. This graceful torrent rushes down into a clear, deep pool which
    flows into a surging stream that vanishes into the undergrowth to the east. Several
    assorted green plants have flourished in the rich soil nearby, complemented by
    a few, blooming lavender rose bushes, all adding the final touch of perfection
    to this heaven on earth. You see a cavern behind the falls to the north, an entrance
    to a cave to the west, and dark forest to the south and east.'
  KRD037: '...You''re in a small clearing in a forest. The sweet smell of springtime
    drifts through the gentle breeze in this small, grassy clearing. Dew drips from
    the petals of the assorted flowers which are blooming freely here, and the ground
    is soft and damp. Above you, the sky is a beautiful, bright shade of blue with
    fluffy, white clouds sailing smoothly across the horizon. Your soul feels at peace
    in this natural sanction. Surrounding you in all directions is a deep, green forest.'
  KRD038: '...You''re near the Fountain of Eternal Magic. Concealed for eons within
    the depths of the surrounding dark forest, this enchanting and mystical jet of
    shimmering, iridescent water rises grandly before you. Rising from a beautiful
    well, carved from the purest white marble, this resplendent wonder radiates an
    aura of powerful sorcery, its glittering water inviting you to drink its enticing
    ambrosia. A splendid portrait of the Goddess Tashanna has been inscribed in the
    base of this fountain along with an engraving which reads "aeid treven alliw suoy
    irof levol yym ftub ayb tseog aemit sdna issap lsdnegel y f". Dark forest lies
    in all directions.'
  KRD039: '...You''re near a platinum tree. Yet another wonder of the world of the
    Goddess Tashanna, before you rises a magnificent oak tree magically turned to
    solid platinum, sparkling in the sunlight. Even more awe-inspiring, however, are
    the branches of this platinum beauty which have grown together in the shape of
    a large heart, emanating an aura of powerful magic and love. In the mystical zephyrs
    which waft around this tree, you hear whispers of words that you cannot clearly
    hear, but which bring peace to your soul. Dark forest surrounds you in all directions.'
  KRD040: '...You''re in a small field of lilacs. A breezy, sunlit opening within
    the vast forest, this small field is alive with the grass and lilacs waving in
    the gentle wind. Without the tall trees of the forest obstructing too much of
    your view, you can now discern large mountains, shrouded in purplish mists, far
    off in the west. You are also quite aware of the continuous buzzing of assorted
    insects which swarm around you in this grassy clearing. Dark forest awaits you
    in all directions.'
  KRD041: '...You''re at the Secret Shrine of Tashanna. Hidden behind the plunging
    cascade of water and covered in purplish mists, this sacred spot radiates an aura
    of unmatched "good". The shrine itself is in the shape of a unicorn, carved from
    pure silver, which glitters in the spray of the waterfall, shining in a holy brilliance
    that fills your soul with awe. The rest of this wizened cavern appears to have
    been carved from solid, unflawed amethyst, which sparkles incandescently, dazzling
    you with its iridescence. The only exit is through the waterfall to the south.'
  KRD042: '...You''re near a large statue. Located in the middle of dark forest, this
    incredible work of art would be amazing if discovered within the finest art gallery
    of Kyrandia, and far so lost deep in the center of a dark forest. You feel a powerful
    urge to examine the statue more closely, and in your mind you cannot help but
    to wonder about the nature of the artist who created this, his inspiration and
    dedication. Dark forest lies in all directions.'
  KRD043: '...You''re at the entrance to a dark cave. Before you rises a colossal
    mountain cliff of solid granite with a small, dark hole at the base, leading into
    a dark cave. The ground is rather rocky, with assorted patches of grass sprouting
    like oases in a desert of gray granite. To the east, a large waterfall thunders
    loudly, as a smaller, terraced waterfall flows off to the south. The cave entrance
    is to the north.'
  KRD101: '...You''re in a dark forest. Tall, ominous pine trees surround you, their
    thick, bristly branches hanging down and making it difficult to proceed in any
    direction. Almost all of the sunlight is blocked out by the densely packed trees,
    and the few rays which do filter down create dark, menacing shadows which seem
    to dance along the leafy forest floor. As you glance around, you happen to notice
    a small shrine, almost completely hidden in the underbrush. You feel a tingle
    of excitement in your very heart and soul. It is very confusing to determine your
    exact location.'
  KRD170: '...You''re in a dark cave. This natural excavation in the granite of the
    mountain is not very large. The walls, floor, and ceiling of this dark hole are
    jagged and uneven making it difficult to keep your balance. The air is extremely
    humid and water drips from the ceiling high above, creating an eerie atmosphere
    to the entire place. Sunlight finds its way in from the opening to the south,
    and dark, twisting caverns wind off in all other directions.'
  KRD178: '...You''re in a natural hall. This long passageway has been smoothly carved
    from the solid granite of this mountain, in contrast to the jagged caverns to
    the south. Oddly enough, there is a strong smell of sulfur in the air, almost
    choking you with its strength. This strange hall continues off into the darkness
    to the north, from which a cold, eerie wind gently blows. The caverns twist off
    to the south.'
  KRD179: '...You''re at a bottomless chasm. At the northern end of a great natural
    hall, this wide, dark pit lies ominously before you, as though taunting you with
    its impassibility. There appears to be no way around this blockade; the ceiling
    of this cavern is very high, the walks are smooth and slippery, and the chasm
    expands from wall to wall and is at least twenty feet across. Far on the other
    side, you see a sparkling jade cavern, its beauty tempting you almost mockingly.
    There is a natural hall which continues off to the south.'
  KRD180: '...You''re in a jade cavern. Multiple hues of beautiful jade sparkle around
    you in this cavern of precious gems. All the walls, floor, and ceiling of this
    incredible natural chamber shine with their own incandescent light, their combined
    brilliance lighting the surroundings in a holy, green aura. A huge, bottomless
    chasm blocks the way to the south, while a dark passage in the far side of this
    lovely cavern leads off to the north.'
  KRD181: '...You''re at a statue of Tashanna. Before you rises a lovely sculptured
    statue of the Goddess Tashanna, Lady of Legends. It rises from an iron base and
    extends up about eight feet to the ceiling of this smooth cavern. A beautifully
    carved marble path leads off to a large structure to the east. You hear a distant
    thunder of rushing water off to the north, and from a dark passageway to the south
    you see a faint glimmer of green light.'
  KRD182: '...You''re near a reflecting pool. This peaceful and delightful pool has
    been ornately hand-carved from the purest marble. The water of the pool is crystal
    clear, and it sparkles in the light of this large cavern, reflecting a faint image
    of you as you peer into it. You also notice many intricate symbols at the bottom
    of the pool, traced by pure gold, although you can identify none of them. A large,
    marble structure rises off to the east, while a marble path leads to the west.'
  KRD183: '...You''re at the forgotten Pantheon of Tashanna. Long lost within the
    depths of this hidden underground city, this ancient temple of the Lady of Legends,
    Tashanna, is perhaps the greatest legend of all Kyrandia. Folklore of ages past
    claim this spot to be the greatest pinnacle of the power of Tashanna. Constructed
    from pure marble pillars embedded with mystical symbols of silver and gold, and
    covered in purplish mists, this holy sanction radiates an aura of eternal peace
    and love. An odd-shaped marble archway lies to the east and a reflecting pool
    is located to the west.'
  KRD184: '...You''re at the Portal of the Past. Huge, marble archways line the entrance
    to this relatively small marble chamber. On the far side of this chamber a shimmering,
    magical portal radiates with an enchanting, multi-chromatic light. Many strange
    and wonderful visions flash through the portal, almost holding you spellbound
    with their dancing, iridescent images. Unfortunately, the visions change so quickly,
    you can rarely catch more than a brief, blurry flash. The only exit appears to
    be the marble archways leading off to the west.'
  KRD185: '...You''re in a smooth-walled alcove. Dark and barren, this small, natural
    chamber has few noticeable features. The ceiling is about two feet above your
    head, and is made of the same smooth and solid granite of the floor and walls.
    The west side of this tiny cave has a noticeable, fist-sized crevice, and you
    hear the faint rush of water from somewhere around you. The only exit is to the
    south.'
  KRD186: '...You''re in a dark cave. This damp, gloomy location is characterized
    only by jagged rock covered with fungi and bacteria. A dominating odor of decay
    fills your nostrils making it difficult to breathe. Your attention is caught by
    a fancy, large machine sitting in the corner. The only exit is a bright passageway
    to the north.'
  KRD187: '...You''re in a bright passageway. This mystical hall appears to be pure
    light, radiating in awe-inspiring brilliance all around you. You feel as if you
    are floating in mid-air. There seem to be no boundaries as to where you can go,
    however, you do notice what appear to be exits from this spectacular wonder to
    the north and south.'
  KRD188: '...You''re at some misty ruins. A thick layer of purplish mists blanket
    this entire cavern; the mists are so smooth and beautiful, however, they almost
    seem like a magical, royal carpet. Shrouded within the mists, you see faint glimpses
    of broken marble pillars, as though this was once some great temple. In the center
    of this mysterious cavern, a bright blue orb of pure light floats, mystically
    suspended in midair. A strange feeling enters your very soul, and an eerie wind
    seems to whisper as it blows across your face. The only exit is a bright passageway
    to the south.'
  KRD189: '...You''re on a sandy beach near the sea. The beautiful, bright blue sea
    lies to the south, where it seems to extend on forever, except for a few distant
    mountain peaks across the sparkling water to the south. The crashing of the small
    waves on the wet sand near the water sounds like faraway thunder, which conjures
    up strange memories of your early childhood. The beach becomes more grassy to
    the north.'
  KRD190: '...You''re on a grassy beach. Large clumps of long, soft grass cover almost
    all of the sand of this little beach. A gentle breeze blows from the south, warm
    and salty, filling your lungs with clean, fresh air. Beautiful, golden forest
    lies off in all directions, except the sea which is off the south.'
  KRD199: '...You''re at a large clump of silver tulips. Beauty within beauty, this
    sparkling, silver tulip bush blooms magically amongst the golden elm trees, seeming
    to naturally blend in with this mystical fantasyland. The enchanted tulips are
    too numerous to count, their almost unending silver magic filling your eyes with
    stars. As rays of sunlight filter down, they''re defracted by the silver into
    many vivid rainbows, truly a wonderful spectacle to witness. Golden forest lies
    off in all directions.'
  KRD201: '...You''re at a crystal tree. This unique crystalline tree has been delicately
    carved in the shape of two hearts bound together in the harmony of nature. This
    beautiful structure sparkles in the sunlight and radiance of the forest around
    it, and its reflected rays of warmth sends a tingle down your spine and fills
    your soul with the touch of love. Golden forest lies off in all directions.'
  KRD204: '...You''re at the Gateway of the Rainbows. Before your eyes rises the most
    breathtakingly beautiful scene you have ever witnessed. An incredible, large archway
    of rainbows shines brilliantly, its vivid spectrum of colors almost blinding you
    with awe. Within the archway, an intricate assortment of "bars" of rainbows create
    a shimmering gateway of beauty, which although lovely, effectively block passage
    through them to the east. Beyond the gateway, you can only imagine what fantastical
    paradises thrive in heavenly sanction. Golden forest lies off in all other directions.'
  KRD207: '...You''re in the Centre of the Elms. The very heart of this magical forest,
    this cluster of golden elm trees is indeed a mystical sight to behold. In the
    center of this sanction, silvery letters float in the air above your head to read:
    "Put your faith before yourself; you shall have but one chance to prove your piety".
    Golden forest lies off in all directions.'
  KRD213: '...You''re at the Altar of Eternal Sunshine. Rising from the depths of
    this seemingly endless golden fantasyland, this silver altar is a magnificent
    representation of the glory of Tashanna. At the base of the altar, there is an
    inscription which reads: "D-tu u-f vo-opx- tqf-m i-sf". The gentle breezes of
    the forest seem especially soothing here. Golden forest lies off in all directions.'
  KRD216: '...You''re on a grassy plain. This open field is covered with short blades
    of soft, green grass which wave like an ocean in the gentle breezes. The air is
    fresh and the sky is clear, but something feels ominous about this peaceful appearing
    picnic ground. Golden forest lies off to the south, and a barren desert is to
    the north.'
  KRD217: '...You''re in a wasteland of decay. This barren desert of death and decay
    radiates an aura of sheer evil. Even the air is stagnant and filled with the odors
    of rotting waste. The ground is hard, grey rock, and the sky is almost as dark.
    You feel a chilling fear in your heart, and the sudden urge to run as fast as
    your feet can carry you. A large mountain lies to the north, and there is a grassy
    plain to the south.'
  KRD218: '...You''re at the Demon Gate. Before you rises a huge mountain face of
    jagged rock which extends high above your view. Directly in front of you is what
    appears to be the form of a gate, carved into the rock, and adorned with elaborate
    figures of devils and demons. In the center of this gate a small niche lies noticeably
    empty, as though waiting for a key. A barren wasteland of decay lies to the south.'
  KRD219: '...You''re in a resplendent cul-de-sac. This royal entrance has been richly
    decorated with fine tapestries and marble structures. The mystical scent of incense
    lingers in the air from times long ago. Gold lettering on the south wall read:
    "Welcome to the Halls of Lady Kyra". A long hallway leads off to the north.'
  KRD220: '...You''re in a long, decorated hallway. Constructed from beautiful marble,
    this long hallway has been adorned with lovely tapestries, a red and gold royal
    carpet, and a faint scent of incense. There''s a cul-de-sac to the south, and
    a large hall to the north.'
  KRD221: '...You''re in the Royal Welcome Hall. This is the royal reception center
    of the Halls of Lady Kyra. Everything has been carpeted in rich red and gold materials,
    filling your heart with a sense of total awe. There is a large sign suspended
    high in the air which reads: "Lady Kyra welcomes you to her castle under the mountain!".
    Flights of marble stairs lie to the east and west, and hallways lead off to the
    north and south.'
  KRD222: '...You''re on a flight of marble stairs. Constructed from solid marble
    and decorated with beautiful, red carpeting, these royal stairs lead up to the
    north, and down to the east.'
  KRD223: '...You''re on a flight of marble stairs. Constructed from solid marble
    and decorated with beautiful, red carpeting, these royal stairs lead up to the
    north, and down to the west.'
  KRD224: '...You''re in a smooth hallway. This smooth, marble hallway has no real
    outstanding features, except for some scratching on the west wall which reads:
    "Travel fast and travel far, thou shall never escape the wrath of Zar". The hallway
    continues to the north and south.'
  KRD225: '...You''re in a crumbling passageway. Constructed from the ancient stone
    of the mountain, this tight hall is crumbling around you. Bits of dust float down
    from the slowly collapsing ceiling. There are small alcoves to the east and west,
    a larger hall to the south, and stairs leading downward to the north.'
  KRD226: '...You''re in an eroded storage closet. This small and barren little room
    was apparently once used for storage of food... or so you assume from the smell
    of rotted provisions that hangs heavily in the air. You happen to notice something
    scraped into the western wall which reads, in a barely decipherable script: "Time
    changes everything". The only exit is a crumbling hall to the east.'
  KRD227: '...You''re in a small, stuffy alcove. This room has many wooden pegs sticking
    out from the eastern wall; you conclude this chamber was once used for storage
    of cloaks and armor, however none lie here. The repulsive odor of large quantities
    of rat droppings fills the air, driving you to uncontrollable nausea... almost.
    The only exit is a crumbling hall to the west.'
  KRD228: '...You''re on a flight of stone stairs. Roughly carved from grayish stone,
    these stairs lead down to the north and up to the south. You also happen to notice
    something carved into one of the steps, a memory of a young couple which reads:
    "T+A Forever".'
  KRD229: '...You''re at the base of a stone stairway. Beneath the main structure
    of this castle under the mountain lies this simple basement construction. A flight
    of stone stairs rises up to the south, and there are exits to the north, east,
    and west. The air is particularly damp down here.'
  KRD230: '...You''re in a stinking, damp passageway. This moist, stone hall is filled
    with an almost unbearable odor of rot and decay. Slime and mold cover all the
    walls, floor, and ceiling. There is a crumbling dungeon cell lying open to the
    south, and you see a flight of stairs to the east.'
  KRD231: '...You''re in an crumbling dungeon cell. Once used to imprison the criminals
    of Kyrandia, this now deserted jail lies barren and empty. A sense of great evil
    lingers in the air, however, making you shiver with a twinge of fear. Something
    doesn''t seem right here, but you just can''t seem to place your finger on what...
    or can you? A stinking, damp passageway leads off to the north.'
  KRD232: '...You''re in the underground animal pen. This smelly cave is saturated
    with the odor of rotted animal waste. The fencing of this pen has long since crumbled
    to dust, leaving only a few deteriorating troughs near the eastern wall. The only
    exit appears to be to the west.'
  KRD233: '...You''re in a decaying, stone hallway. This ancient passage winds off
    to the north and south. An ominous feeling of great magic tingles at your soul
    here, from no apparently visible source.'
  KRD234: '...You''re at a small, abandoned water well. Before your eyes lies a quaint,
    old water well constructed from beautiful, hand-carved red bricks. It has an almost
    magical aura to it -- though simple in design -- and you feel a strange sense
    of eternal peace as you lean near it. You happen to notice a small hole in the
    eastern wall which leads off into darkness. The rest of this chamber seems to
    be crumbling like the other parts of the basement. A decaying, stone hall lies
    off to the south.'
  KRD235: '...You''re in a dark, damp cavern. You can barely see much in this near
    pitch black hole, but you feel yourself on sturdy, though somewhat uneven, terrain.
    A certain moistness lingers in the air, and you feel drops of water from the ceiling
    shrouded in darkness above you. You see a definite exit to the west, but the darkness
    prohibits you from determining what other exits may exist.'
  KRD236: '...You''re in an odd-shaped cave. This chalky cavern seems to be lit by
    the phosphorous nature of its walls and ceiling. In the dim light provided by
    this mysterious mineral, you can see many strange, encrypted symbols, which read:
    "Hqofowy asitpqnm ifqnpytuvc qotmay gioem loopas asit, illiada falgoria simajf.
    Unaloop la heartoy". A dark cavern twists off to the west.'
  KRD237: '...You''re in a tiny, curved cave. Shrouded in almost complete darkness,
    you find it difficult to observe any of the visible features of this cave. However,
    from feeling your way around, you realize that the curved and rocky walls seem
    to be made from sandstone-like rock, while the floor is a very fine and dusty
    sand; you cannot reach the ceiling. You cannot see where any exits may lie, but
    you feel curves of the floor towards the south and east.'
  KRD238: '...You''re in a cavern of diamonds. This magnificent natural beauty is
    illuminated by the magical properties of the walls, floor, and ceiling of this
    breathtaking chamber which seems to be carved from solid diamond. You are almost
    overwhelmed by the sheer extravagance of such a hidden wonder, concealed within
    the depths of the Halls of Lady Kyra. Something special seems to touch your soul
    as you examine your surroundings... a feeling beyond expression with mortal words.
    The only apparent exit is a dark cave to the west.'
  KRD239: '...You''re at an intricate, marble balcony. You''re overlooking the Royal
    Welcome Hall. Dark red carpeting covers the floor, and the balcony itself has
    been intricately carved by a fine craftsman into a beautiful work of marble art.'
  KRD240: '...You''re at the top of a marble stairway. Beautifully carved marbles
    stairs lead downward to the south, covered with a dark red carpet. Halls lead
    off to the east and west.'
  KRD241: '...You''re at the top of a marble stairway. Beautifully carved marbles
    stairs lead downward to the south, covered with a dark red carpet. Halls lead
    off to the east and west.'
  KRD242: '...You''re in a gold-decorated hallway. This lovely passageway has been
    lavishly covered with various gold ornamentations. Large gold lettering on the
    marble floor reads: "Hail to the Lady Kyra". Marble halls continue to the east
    and west.'
  KRD243: '...You''re in the southeast corner. This junction of two marble halls is
    quite splendidly decorated. Beautiful tapestries hang from the walls, and the
    ceiling is a incredibly wonderful portrait of the Lady Kyra. The halls continue
    separately to the north and west.'
  KRD244: '...You''re in a southeast hall. This marble hall is sparsely decorated
    with only a few small murals of faraway lands. Large chambers lie to the east
    and west, and the hall continues to the north and south.'
  KRD245: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Alchemist. This large chamber is filled
    with various scents of strange and mystical spices, decorated with exotic paintings,
    and covered in a rather thick layer of dust. An eerie green light filters down
    from the oddly shaped ceiling above you. The only exit is to the west.'
  KRD246: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Lavender Rose. This gracefully designed
    chamber tells a pictorial history of the lavender roses of Kyrandia. You see a
    lovely mural of the Lady Kyra declaring the lavender rose as the official symbol
    of the Kingdom of Kyrandia. Another beautiful mural portrays the Goddess Tashanna
    creating the lavender rose, taking a plain white rose and touching it with her
    Wand of Rainbows. You cannot help but smile at the sight of such magic. The only
    exit is to the east.'
  KRD247: '...You''re in a northeast hall. This marble hall is decorated with a beautiful
    mural on the ceiling which portrays the quests of many great heroes. As you examine
    it closely, you can recognize a few of the names such as Corvus Andromeda, Richard
    the Lion-Hearted, Anastasia the Beautiful, and many others... even a picture of
    the horrible bastard, The Enchanter. Chambers lie to the east and west, and the
    hall continues to the north and south.'
  KRD248: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Gateway. This majestic chamber of the
    history of Kyrandia has been uniquely decorated with the story of the magical
    Gateway of Rainbows in the golden forest. A dazzlingly colorful painting on the
    ceiling displays the wondrous fantasyland which lies beyond the brilliant hues
    of the Gateway itself. Various murals on the walls describe the legends of the
    Gateway... how only two people of pure heart and soul may pass beyond its majestic
    arches. The only exit from this chamber appears to be to the west.'
  KRD249: '...You''re in the Chamber of Sir Alexis. This beautifully decorated chamber
    of the pictorial history of Sir Alexis, is filled with an air of greatness and
    honor... like the great knight himself. Artistic paintings of this knight''s many
    wonderful deeds portray a vital aspect of the history of Kyrandia -- the romantic
    order of knighthood. The knights of Kyrandia fought for the cause of good, to
    defend righteousness, and to represent the glory of the Goddess Tashanna and the
    wise ruler of the kingdom, the beautiful Lady Kyra. You are amazed at the life-like
    quality of the artwork. The only exit appears to be to the east.'
  KRD250: '...You''re in the northeast corner. The intersection between two great,
    marble hallways is adorned with oil paintings of beautiful landscapes of various
    Kyrandian scenes. Among these are the Magic Sand Castle in the center of the ancient
    kingdom, the lava pits of the Great Volcano of Tears, and a masterpiece depiction
    of the Bard''s Carnival, the magical and musical event of each Kyrandian century.
    The halls lead off to the west and south.'
  KRD251: '...You''re in a silver hall. Everything, from the paint on the wall to
    the silver inscriptions on the floor to the intricate silver chandelier hanging
    above is made of silver. The inscriptions are a replica of an ancient document
    from long ago, which read: "By the glory of the Goddess Tashanna, I swear my eternal
    loyalty to the Lady Kyra and the defense of the Kingdom of Kyrandia. Across time
    and space, Lord Alexis, Knight of the Lavender Rose, Champion of the Lady of the
    Kingdom." Each silver letter seems to sparkle with something special, touching
    your heart with patriotism for this wonderful land. The hall continues to the
    east and west.'
  KRD252: '...You''re in the Hall of Music. This entire chamber reverberates with
    the beautiful sound of one of the ancient romantic songs of Kyrandia past. It
    goes like this: "I live my life in a fantasy land, dreaming of the day when I''ll
    win your hand. Every breath I take, every beat of my heart, my love grows for
    you as it has from the start. Sing me a song of a fairy tale, a story of our magic
    love. Whisper the lyrics in my ear, you''re the one I''ve been dreaming of. All
    the knights of legends past can''t match my love for you. I''d sail the golden
    seas of fantasy and chase the stars for you. Legends pass, but I will still love
    you. You are my paradise, my dream come true. Heaven is in your arms, lying next
    to you. Lady of legends, my dream''s confirmation; queen of a world of my imagination.
    The world of reality believes legends are gone, yet looking in your eyes I see
    legends live on. If I could freeze the hands of time for just one day, I''d ask
    you to come with me and sail far away. Across our rainbow, hand in hand together,
    living a legend and loving forever. Legends pass and time goes by but my love
    for you will never die, ''cause you are my legend come true, legend come true..."
    You may exit to the east or west.'
  KRD253: '...You''re in the Hall of Memories. From the moment you first step into
    this room, your mind is suddenly filled with memories of times, places, and people
    of your past. Some are good and happy, while others are so powerfully filled with
    sorrow and grief, you almost faint from all the emotional pain that surges within
    your heart. Truly, this is one of the strangest of all of the remaining chambers
    of the fortress under the mountain. You may leave to the east or west.'
  KRD254: '...You''re in the Hall of LadyHawk. Dedicated years ago to the great Lady
    of the Hawks, who helped to save the kingdom in the Battle of the Great Dragons
    in the Third Age of Kyrandia, this chamber, unfortunately, has also been looted
    and vandalized by the evil which has passed through here. However, you still have
    a dim memory of the beautiful memories of this lady of ancient times. You may
    leave to the north or the east.'
  KRD255: '...You''re in the Hall of Hearts. Once beautifully decorated with many
    lovely, detailed stone sculptures of hearts of love, this chamber is now an object
    of sheer sorrow and pity. Someone, or something, purposely came through and cracked,
    broke, or completely shattered each and every heart. You mind is overwhelmed with
    the symbolic meaning of this tragic event. You may leave in any direction.'
  KRD256: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Champion. As you glance around this incredible
    chamber, you are left awe-struck with the sheer magnificence of it''s artistic
    beauty. Everything from the floor to the ceiling is one, breathtaking mural depicting
    the service of Lady Kyra''s famed champion. In the air you hear the echoing of
    a voice singing "I''ll be the hero you''ve been dreaming of...". You may leave
    to the west.'
  KRD257: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Lady. This magical chamber is covered
    with lovely paintings of the legendary Lady Kyra. This was her room, created with
    love and care by the finest architects of the entire kingdom. However, it is now
    dark and empty... the lady, like all the other fantastic beauties of Kyrandia,
    has vanished. Questions in your mind: "Is she gone forever?" "Can this world ever
    live again?" "What IS the power of true love?". Only time will tell. You may leave
    to the east.'
  KRD258: '...You''re in the Hall of Winter. Once known as the Hall of Spring, this
    cold and deserted chamber is now dead... the beautiful life it once had has disappeared
    and vanished into eternal desolation. A biting chill runs down the back of your
    neck, leaving you shivering in sorrow. You may go in any direction.'
  KRD259: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Bard. This splendidly decorated room is
    filled with murals of the history of the many great bards, including the most
    famous of all, Brin. Enscribed in golden gothic letters are some of the lyrics
    of one of his more popular songs, "Fairy Tales", which read: If you believe in
    magic, or wish upon a star... Then fantasy can touch your life, no matter who
    you are It doesn''t matter how old you are, or if you''re rich or poor Your imagination
    is the key that opens any door... And nothing is impossible, if only you believe...
    Once you find your dreamworld, you''ll never want to leave You can ride a winged
    horse high into the skies... And as reality fades away your spirit starts to rise
    As you read the inscriptions, a beautiful melody runs through your mind, sending
    a tingle through your soul. The only exit appears to be to the west.'
  KRD260: '...You''re the Chamber of the Magician. This mystical chamber was once
    the quarters of the honorable magician known as "The Wanderer". Colorful murals
    of magical events, famous wizards, and mysterious, faraway places cover the walls
    and ceiling. In center of the floor lies various wizard-like symbols, including
    the ancient truth, "Love is a power beyond all magic". The only visible exit is
    to the east.'
  KRD261: '..You''re in the Chamber of Poetry. This small room was once used to glorify
    some of the greatest poets and poems of the kingdom of Kyrandia. However, it too
    has long been deserted, but one last poem remains carved on the otherwise barren
    stone floor. The poem reads: Through the looking glass I spied A fantasy forest
    that long ago died And standing there''s a little girl All alone and teary-eyed
    Bewildered and mystified In her forest, against the world All alone in her fantasy
    forest You may exit to the east or south.'
  KRD262: '...You''re in an empty garden. This strange and lonely chamber was apparently
    once a small, beautiful garden, but died long ago, leaving the flagstones bare...
    nothing grows here no more. A sudden feeling of sadness overwhelms you, as tears
    fall from your eyes for the unknown gardener who once cared for this now empty
    garden. You can leave to the east or west.'
  KRD263: '...You''re in the Hall of the Sea. A lovely painting of a seaside romance
    is depicted on the ceiling of this strange chamber. A sudden chill enters the
    depths of your heart here, beyond anything you have ever felt before, almost bringing
    you to your knees. You may leave to the east or west.'
  KRD264: '...You''re in the Hall of Marble Pillars. Beautifully designed, this was
    once a wonderful center for the great philosophers of old to meet and discuss
    life, the universe, and everything. However, it has long been deserted, the pillars
    are starting to crumble, and an overall feeling of gloom blankets everything in
    misery. Archways highlight exits in all directions.'
  KRD265: '...You''re in the northern Hall of Tashanna. Your eyes can see nothing
    here. You can go to the north or south.'
  KRD266: '...You''re in the southern Hall of Tashanna. Your eyes can see nothing
    here. You can go to the north or south.'
  KRD267: '...You''re in a grey-black hall. Everything seem extremely dismal here,
    and you feel the sudden urge to leave as quickly as your feet can carry you. You
    may follow this urge to the north or the south.'
  KRD268: '...You''re on a red carpeted stairway. This red-carpeted stairway is stained
    with the tears of the Great Death, which passed, not so long ago, through this
    magical kingdom, destroying all the beauty which once existed in this fantasyworld.
    You feel helpless, because you are helpless. That''s life for you! Speaking of
    helpless, I hope you ARE aware that there is a very large and very nasty dragon
    searching to cook your buns to a nice crisp and then feast upon your flesh. Have
    a nice day, and by the way, you can go north and south, or you can just do nothing!'
  KRD269: '...You''re in a red carpeted hall. Well, everything''s red. You suddenly
    recollect an old saying, "Love is like a red, red rose... it has thorns, soon
    dies, and generally isn''t worth the trouble that comes with it". (Yeah, I know
    the author is switching the theme, but who reads long descriptions anyway). This
    thought does not brighten your day. Stairs go down to the south, and there''s
    something to the north.'
  KRD270: '...You''re nowhere really. You can go to the east, west, north, and gee,
    even south. That means you can go in all directions. Have fun, and don''t forget,
    dragon feces rolls downhill.'
  KRD271: '...You''re on a marble stairway. The stairs lead up to the north, and down
    to the east. Not much more to say, except you smell the distinctive odor of dragon''s
    urine here.'
  KRD272: '...You''re on a marble stairway. The stairs lead up to the north, and down
    to the west. Not much more to say, except you smell the distinctive odor of dragon''s
    urine here.'
  KRD273: '...You''re at the top of a marble stairway. There is a balcony to the east,
    and marble stairs leading down to the south. Everything seems to be shrouded in
    a cloud of evil darkness.'
  KRD274: '...You''re on a marble balcony. This well-constructed gothic-style (god
    we have alot of dashes here!) balcony has been blackened by the flames of a very
    powerful dragon. Darkness is everywhere, blackness shrouds anything and everything,
    and a feeling of general gloom pervades everything. Home, sweet home. You can
    go to marble stairs leading down to the east and west, or you can go up stairs
    to the north.'
  KRD275: '...You''re at the top of a marble stairway. There is a balcony to the west,
    and marble stairs leading down to the south. Everything seems to be shrouded in
    a cloud of evil darkness.'
  KRD276: '...You''re on a spiral stairway. This boring stairway leads up to the north
    and down to the south. On one of the stairs an inscription reads "From the light
    comes darkness, and darkness shall rule forever."'
  KRD277: "\e[0m...You're on a spiral stairway. You can go north (up) or south (down).\
    \ Enjoy."
  KRD278: "\e[0m...You're on the mountain's peak. From this high, top-of-the-world\
    \ ledge you can see the beautiful land of Kyrandia stretching for an eternity\
    \ in all directions. You see off in the distance the Golden Forest, the Silver\
    \ Sea, and far, far away you can faintly see the silhouette of the incredible\
    \ SandCastle of Kyrandia, the capital of this once great kingdom. You gasp in\
    \ awe, as you feel like you are living only in a dreamworld. The only exit is\
    \ the stairs down to the south."
  KRD279: '...You''re in a blue-carpeted hall. Everything has been decorated with
    a beautiful silk carpeting, from the floor to the ceiling, creating a plush environment
    for warm greetings and royal processions. You may go to the north or south.'
  KRD280: "\e[0m...You're in the Chamber of Truth. This plain, marble room is completely\
    \ barren, except for yet another inscription on the floor which reads: \"Seek\
    \ the truth here.\" Exits lie off in all directions."
  KRD281: "\e[0m...You're in the lonely hall. As you glance around this barren stone\
    \ chamber, a sudden surge of emptiness fills your soul, bringing the emotions\
    \ of hopelessness and despair to your heart. A tear runs down your cheek, but\
    \ you brush it away and deep inside you feel the inspiration to bring life once\
    \ again to the world of Kyrandia. This hall leads off to the east and west."
  KRD282: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Body. This corner-chamber is mundanely
    decorated, except for the quite noticeable feature of a large chasm splitting
    one half of the room. It''s width, strangely enough, is difficult to accurately
    estimate -- you cannot help but wonder if you could successfully jump across.
    There are smaller halls leading off to the north and west.'
  KRD283: '...You''re in blackened quadrangle. Apparently decimated a while ago by
    a great blast of fire, nothing remains of this intersection of four chambers.
    You can go to the north, south, east, or west.'
  KRD284: '...You''re at the Waterfall of Fantasy. Shrouded here in purplish mists
    lies the most awe-inspiring wonderment of the magic of Tashanna... the mystical
    Waterfall of Fantasy. Before you, rising high into the clouds, this majestic cascade
    of beautifully clear water sparkles flamingly as it rushes from the heavens to
    this dreamworld come true, stepping down on plateaus made of pure emerald. At
    the bottom of this jeweled cataract, an enchanting, crystal clear pool has formed
    in serene harmony with this enchanting place of legends. The air is filled with
    the sweet aroma of the surrounding lavender rose bushes and the melodious music
    of songbirds singing in joy. In the sky, night and day, shines the brightest rainbow
    you''ve ever seen... and floating above it are golden letters which read: "ATASILYF".
    The only exit is to the east.'
  KRD285: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Mind. The only really noticeable feature
    of this room is some writing on the floor which reads: This thing all things devours;
    Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to
    meal; Slays kings, ruins town, And beats high mountains down. The only exits are
    to the west and south.'
  KRD286: '...You''re in the Hall of Feasting. This hall was once used to hold the
    great feast of the honorable Lady Kyra. It''s latest feast, however, was the feast
    the dragon Zar had upon the flesh of the last inhabitants of this kingdom under
    the mountain. Remnants of human bones and other body parts, as well as large globs
    of blood stains, are everywhere, mandating the evil which has taken over this
    cold, grey place. You can exit to the east and west if you wish, or you can just
    choose to stay here and rot like everything else.'
  KRD287: '...You''re in a hall. The hall continues to the east and west.'
  KRD288: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Heart. This particular room has a certain
    warmth to it, setting your spirit to peace. Nothing spectacular seems to catch
    your attention, except for an inscription on the west wall, which reads: "Commitment
    of the heart strengthens the soul." The only exits are to the north and east.'
  KRD289: '...You''re in a crumbling centre. This intersection of four chambers is
    slowly being destroyed by the decay of time. Once long, long ago this chamber
    was cared for and loved, but now it has been abandoned and left to waste away
    into oblivion. There are chambers in all directions.'
  KRD290: '...You''re in the Chamber of Eternal Magic. If this magical room once contained
    any powerful sorcery, it has long since been destroyed. You notice a roughly carved
    inscription in the far wall which read: "Nothing is Eternal". You find your soul
    void of any and all feelings in this strangely familiar location, and you feel
    yourself growing weak and faint. You cannot help but contemplate the peace of
    death. The only exit is to the west.'
  KRD291: '...You''re in the Chamber of the Soul. This mystical room strikes you with
    complete awe. As you look around, everything seems to extend forever, in an infinitely
    large universe... with no boundaries. Far in the distance billions of stars glimmer
    as whole galaxies grow and die before your eyes. Within your vision, you are witnessing
    eternity... beyond any and all mortal limitations. You feel the rush of time passing
    by, oblivious to all things of physical nature. Doorways of light are exits to
    the south and east.'
  KRD292: '...You''re in a barren hall. Except for the dirty and worn marble floor,
    walls, and ceiling, there is nothing else of interest. Looking at such total emptiness
    makes you only more aware of the sheer desolation of this once dreamy fantasy
    world. Emotions of remorse, hopelessness, and plain disgust fill your heart, soul,
    mind, and body. The hall continues to the east and west.'
  KRD293: '...You''re in the chamber of the magic orb. In the center of this room,
    floating high in the air, is the fading silhouette of a once great orb. Perhaps
    long ago it was a materialized reality, but now it has faded to a mere quasi-real
    image. Your hand passes freely through it, and it seems oblivious to your existence.
    Nothing really remains of this ancient magic... like everything in Kyrandia, this
    fantasy seems to be dying too. The only exit from this room is a crumbling archway
    to the east.'
  KRD294: '...You''re in the Chamber of Hidden Magic. This room, like most wonderful
    things in life, is only a dream. It doesn''t exist.'
  KRD295: '...You''re in the Chamber of Life. This is a dimly lit room, with a somber
    ambiance and a low hum that emanates from deep within. The floor is made of the
    purest white marble, and placed exactly in the center of the room is an unadorned
    altar. Exits lie to the north and south.'
  KRD296: '...You''re in a beautiful, small chapel. Oh, how lovely this religious
    chamber appears to your worldly eye... all delicate and "good" amongst the chaos
    of reality. The silver altar on the far side (don''t bother looking, it doesn''t
    have an extra description) is tarnished, something that you notice with considerable
    irony -- after all, it is the holy focus of the WONDERFUL Goddess Tashanna. You
    look around and suddenly realize: this world is no longer a living fantasy, but
    instead a cold, grey world, long forgotten by it''s patron goddess. You feel the
    desire to leave; the exit is to the west.'
  KRD297: '...You''re at a hidden, emerald shrine. This fantasy room does not exist.'
  KRD298: '...You''re in the Hall of the Royal Knights. Before your eyes lies yet
    another "great" hall of this kingdom under the mountain. You smirk as you glance
    at its gothic architecture, again, made mostly from marble like everything else
    in this forgotten realm. You spit on the floor in disgust. At your last glance,
    you also notice a triangular rune in the center of the floor. Words inscribed
    beside it say, "Patience, wisdom, and faith are the devotions of fools". Plain,
    old exits lead to the north, south, and east.'
  KRD299: '...You''re in the Hall of the Throne. Constructed from the purest of marble,
    in a Gothic-style architecture, this beautiful hall served as both a greetings
    chamber for those who came to see the Lady Kyra and a feasting hall for any special
    royal banquets or other such events. Once alive with activity, it now lies empty'
  KRD300: '...You''re in the royal kitchen. This rather large room was once used to
    prepare the great feasts and banquets for the Lady Kyra and her guests. Now, however,
    it lies barren and deserted, as if some horrible evil had vanquished the good
    magic that once thrived here. A strong odor of sulfur floats from the northern
    wall. The Hall of the Throne lies to the west.'
  KRD301: '...You''re in the throne chamber. Once the great hall where the Lady Kyra
    herself ruled the Kingdom of Kyrandia, this Gothic-style chamber has been trashed
    by some unknown force. The walls and floor have large cracks in them, dust and
    debris cover everything, and anything of value has long since been looted by thieves.
    You also notice a huge hole in the northern wall, beyond which lies a pitch-black
    darkness. A evil stench of death and decay emanates from that hole. The Hall of
    the Throne lies to the south.'
  KRD302: '...You''re in the lair of the dragon. This dark, gloomy cave radiates an
    aura of incredible evil. The darkness hides almost all the features of this large,
    ragged cavern, but the distinctive odor of dragon waste identifies this place
    as a lair of a dragon. A chill of fear runs through your blood and your heart
    beats fast as the effects of dragonfear overcome you. The throne chamber lies
    to the south.'
  KRD303: '...You''re in the Forest of Fantasy.'
  KRD304: '...You''re at the Waterfall of Fantasy. Shrouded here in purplish mists
    lies the most awe-inspiring wonderment of the magic of Tashanna... the mystical
    Waterfall of Fantasy. Before you, rising high into the clouds, this majestic cascade
    of beautifully clear water sparkles flamingly as it rushes from the heavens to
    this dreamworld come true, stepping down on plateaus made of pure emerald. At
    the bottom of this jeweled cataract, an enchanting, crystal clear pool has formed
    in serene harmony with this enchanting place of legends. The air is filled with
    the sweet aroma of the surrounding lavender rose bushes and the melodious music
    of songbirds singing in joy. In the sky, night and day, shines the brightest rainbow
    you''ve ever seen... and floating above it are golden letters which read: "ATASILYF".
    The Forest of Fantasy lies to the west.'

  INTROA: Welcome, brave and adventurous one, to the wondrous and magical game of
    Kyrandia, Fantasy World of Legends!! You are about to journey to a fantasy land
    far, far away... a land of swords and sorcery where the only limit is your own
    imagination. You will travel to the world of Kyrandia, a fairy tale land of magic
    and mystery, realm of the beautiful and powerful goddess of Kyrandia, Tashanna,
    the "Lady of Legends." Here, you begin as a young apprentice from a small village
    who seeks to grow in knowledge, wisdom, and power, with high hopes of being granted
    the title of "Arch-Mage of Legends" -- the mightiest wizard of Kyrandia! To achieve
    your goal, you must cross the lands of Kyrandia, face unknown perils, solve mystical
    enigmas, battle rivalrous mages, and conqueror your own mind, body, and soul.
    Time has stood still for too long on Kyrandia -- now is the time for one mage
    to rise above and master the powers of sorcery and magic. Press ENTER to continue
  INTROB: 'However, before you begin your adventure, here''s a brief explanation of
    how to play: Kyrandia is a multi-player interactive game, where many people at
    once can adventure with each other in the same simulated adventure world. Players
    can help one another, engage in battle, trade information, or just "shoot the
    breeze." To move about in Kyrandia, type the direction you want your character
    to go (north, south, east or west). You can speak with other players using action
    verbs. For example, if you were to type "say hello there", other players at the
    same location would see "hello there." You may pick up objects and do things with
    them. You can look at your current surroundings or other players. Almost any mundane
    action you can think of can be performed. However, the world of Kyrandia is much,
    much more. The underlying theme of the entire game is the use of magic. Similar
    in concept to the popular role-playing game "Dungeons & Dragons," players are
    "magic-users" who start at level 1 (Apprentice) and advance to higher levels and
    more powerful magic. Press ENTER to continue'
  INTROC: Although you must be the one to discover all the details (and many there
    are) of the magic of Kyrandia, we'll give you a little help to start off with.
    Spells are magic cast by players, sometimes at objects or other players. To cast
    a spell a player must first have it memorized. He must also have enough spell
    points to cast it, and must be of high enough level for certain spells. Also,
    some spells require the player to have certain components (objects) to cast them.
    To actually cast the spell, a player must type "cast" and then the secret incantation
    of the spell to be cast; sometimes, a direct object must be included as well,
    such as "at the elf". The physical strength and endurance of a player is determined
    by his "hit points." A player's hit points increase as he gains levels or by magical
    means. It is through hit points that most players battle each other; when a player's
    hit points reach 0, he is killed, and must start from scratch at the beginning
    again. To see what spells you have memorized and how many spell points you have,
    type "spells". To see how many hit points you have, type "hits". To see what objects
    you are holding, type "inv". And if you need it, type "help". Press ENTER to continue
  INTROD: You may ask what great treasure lies in this adventure? You will run across
    many exciting characters and travel through breathtaking scenery. Beyond that,
    explore this great world to find what is hidden for you. The first player to reach
    the end will be granted the title of "Arch-Mage of Legends." Kyrandia is based
    upon a complete Fantasy World created by Scott Brinker; it was programmed by Scott
    Brinker and Richard Skurnick in March-June of 1988, and is based on multi-player
    interactive game concepts originated by Tim Stryker. Also, thanks are due to those
    who gave the support and inspiration to make this fantasy a reality. Kyrandia
    is dedicated to the lonely souls of the world; type "help fantasy" in the game
    for more. Enjoy the magic, mystery, and mirth of Kyrandia, Fantasy World of Legends!

  HLPMSG: 'Help is available for the following subjects: commands ... what you can
    do fantasy .... a note from the author gold ....... "money" of Kyrandia hits .......
    your strength/combat levels ..... advancing in Kyrandia spells ..... the magic
    of Kyrandia winning .... solving the game Type "help <subject>" (example: "help
    fantasy") at the prompt. To exit type "X". You will be placed in the same spot
    when you return.'
  HLPCOM: '...Suddenly, a small elf runs out from nowhere! He gives you a nod and
    a smile and whispers in your ear... Kyrandia is a multi-player fantasy adventure.
    You can speak with other players using action verbs. For example, if you were
    to type "say hello there", other players at the same location would see "hello
    there." You can move around the large world of Kyrandia by telling the computer
    which direction you wish to go (example: west). You can abbreviate these commands
    for your convenience: n(orth), s(outh), e(ast), and w(est). In some instances,
    you can also use special commands too (example: climb the tree). Also, it is rumored
    travel can be done magically as well! You can pick up objects and use them in
    assorted ways (you can experiment for yourself). Also, for added novelty, you
    can do numerous "mundane" actions, such as: smile, laugh, kick <Player-ID>, wink,
    hug <Player-ID>, and many more! The rest you have to figure out on your own! Good
    luck! *** The elf then bows swiftly to you and disappears in a puff of smoke!'
  HLPFAN: It has taken over two years to fully visualize this Fantasy World of Kyrandia,
    a mirror-image of a dreamworld inspired by love and fashioned by imagination.
    Created with smiles and tears, hopes and fears, and a passion of the soul immeasurable
    by mortal definitions, Kyrandia holds a magic beyond sorcery; a magic that will
    bloom like the lavender roses of Kyrandia across time and space forever... love.
    This entire work is dedicated to my Lady of Legends, the one who dances eternally
    in my dreams; forever alive in my heart and soul, beyond reality, but never beyond
    imagination and hope, over the rainbow, in the fantasy forest where wishes come
    true and the emeralds sparkle in the waterfall forever more. Although Kyrandia
    is an adventure game, filled with action, excitement, and interaction, I ask you
    to also take some time amongst the casting of fireballs and battling of monsters
    to examine the scenery of Kyrandia and delve into the deeper meanings of this
    visionary Fantasy World. Thank you so much for partaking in this humble world
    of mine. I wish you the best of luck, in Kyrandia, and in everything in life.
    Farewell. Scott James Brinker (fantasy author/programmer)
  HLPGOL: '...As you ask for a help, a genie suddenly pops out in a cloud of smoke,
    smiles, and says to you... Welcome to Kyrandia! I''m so pleased and honored to
    have you in my humble world. Thank you so, so much for joining this wonderful
    fantasy land! However, you wish to know about gold, huh? Well, as you''ve probably
    already concluded, gold is the currency of Kyrandia, similar to the "dollar" of
    your original world. You can use gold to buy things from the many different people
    you will meet in Kyrandia, or for other, more arcane purposes. To get gold, well,
    you have to get it the hard way -- find it. Or, if you''re a good alchemist, you
    might be able to make it? Ah, well that''s up to you to discover. If you''re having
    trouble finding gold out in the vast wilderness of Kyrandia, you could always
    try and get a job. Rumor has it many village store keepers are always looking
    for good adventurers. Anyway, hope I''ve been of some assistance, but I have to
    run for now. Have a great time, and I bid you well on all your adventures in Kyrandia!
    *** The genie disappears in a flash of forked, blue lightning!'
  HLPHIT: '...As you make your request for some aid, an old, wise man suddenly appears
    before you, gives you a small grin, and says... "Hit points" are the representation
    of your character''s strength, health, and endurance. When your hit points reaches
    zero, your character dies. As you grow in power (gain levels) your number of hit
    points increase. You combat with people through the use of magic, ultimately to
    bring their hit points to zero. You can use spells or magical items, but the result
    is usually the same. However, if you wish to be really slick, you can also attack
    people in other ways besides lowering their hit points -- I''ll leave it up to
    you to discover how... You can also combat with the many different creatures of
    Kyrandia, but you best beware: their power is often way beyond your magic! When
    a character dies, he (or she) is automatically restarted at the very beginning
    of the game, near the willow tree, at level 1. *** The old man then gives you
    a respectful bow and vanishes in a puff of smoke, but not before grinning to himself.'
  HLPLEV: '...As you call out for help, a flash of incredibly bright light blinds
    you! *** Before you stands the Goddess Tashanna, shining in sheer beauty. She
    kisses your check and says... Your power is measured in "levels" in Kyrandia,
    which determine how many "hit points" you have, how many "spell points" you have,
    and how powerful of spells you may cast. You gain 2 spell points per level, and
    you gain 4 hit points per level. (see "help spells" and "help hits"). Each level
    also has a "title", or name, associated with it. For example, when you start at
    level 1, you are titled "Apprentice"; to win the game, you must become an "Arch-Mage
    of Legends". (see "help winning"). It is up to you to discover exactly how many
    levels there are, and their respective titles. However, everyone wears a "Patch
    of Sorcery" which declares their title (type "look <so-and-so>"). You may also
    look at yourself to admire your own title too. Above all else, remember... some
    things are more powerful than magic! *** The Goddess Tashanna then smiles at you,
    and vanishes in a purple flash!'
  HLPSPE: '...A tall, ominous wizard dressed in deep blue robes suddenly appears before
    you in a column of orange flame! He bows to you and begins to speak... Kyrandia
    is a world of magic. To become powerful in Kyrandia, you therefore must master
    the art of spellweaving. The spell system of Kyrandia works like this: every player
    has a "spellbook" in which he keeps the spells he can memorize; no one can steal
    this book, and the player cannot lose it. Once a spell is in the spellbook, a
    player may memorize that spell (type: memorize <spell name>). You can have up
    to ten spells "memorized" at the same time. A player then may cast any spell he
    has memorized (type: cast <spell name>). Some spells also require a direct object
    (a target), such as a person, place, or thing; the direct object should be placed
    right after the spell name when being cast. Also note that some spells require
    certain components (objects) or other special circumstances to be successfully
    cast. You must also be of a certain level to cast different spells; the most powerful
    spells can only be cast by those of high enough level. *** The wizard then bows
    and vanishes into thin air!'
  HLPWIN: '...An image of the author, Scott Brinker, appears in a shimmering circle
    of rainbows! He smiles and says... To "win" Kyrandia, you must master the magic
    of this world and gain the title of "Arch-Mage of Legends". Upon reaching this
    high level, you are eligible to collect any prize the System Operator of this
    realm may be offering. The game will notify you of how to collect your prize and
    glory. Let it be known that only the FIRST player to solve Kyrandia (on this system)
    may be the one to receive the prize. However, everyone who takes part in the experience
    of Kyrandia can win; if not a materialistic award of credits, then many hours
    of enjoyable gaming, the thrill of magical Dungeons & Dragons combat, and special
    insight into a dreamworld created from true love -- an enchanting, parallel fantasy
    of the world of reality in which we all live. I''m sorry, but I can''t give you
    any "hints" or "solutions", because after all, that would take away all the excitement
    and adventure I''ve created for you! However, I do suggest you see with your heart
    as well as your eyes... *** He then shakes your hand, smiles again, and vanishes
    in his iridescent circle of rainbows.'

    bottom, and the entire staff radiates powerful magic.'
  KID031: '...Bubbling and frothing constantly, this pinkish-red potion is most certainly
    one of the strangest concoctions in all of Kyrandia. A distinctive odor of many
    potent and mysterious spices emanates from the center of this magical liquid,
    tempting you to drink its enchanting substance.'
  KID032: '...About the size of your palm, this appears to be just an ordinary pinecone.

    elaborately into the trunk, which read: "-n--l, oh servant of Tashanna, and pay
    homage to thy source of life energy, for thy power to be recognized by the forces
